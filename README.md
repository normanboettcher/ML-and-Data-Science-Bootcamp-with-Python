source: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/

This repository contains some exercises from the udemy course above.

-----------------------------------------Why I created this Repository---------------------------------------------------------

My goal is to do practical exercises in Python with ML/Data Science and at the same time to gain experience with git and github.
This is my first repository on github, so I am very new on this field.
